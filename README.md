## Versioning
PyPhon adheres to Semantic Versioning 2.0.0. If there is a violation of
this scheme, report it as a bug. Specifically, if a patch or minor version is
released and breaks backward compatibility, that version should be immediately
yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that restores
compatibility. Any change that breaks the public API will only be introduced at
a major-version release. As a result of this policy, you can (and should)
specify any dependency on _project-name_ by using the Pessimistic Version
Constraint with two digits of precision.
